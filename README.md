eaio
====

io-library from ea extracted from the webkit source release, HEAVILY MODIFIED!

beware, the latest drops from ea seems to miss much of the functionality (see EAFileUtil.cpp), but
in older versions it's available. I think they let run something like headerguard run over the 
sources to remove not-enabled platform ifdefs, but for eaio they've removed too much...
